# blender-ogf
OGF-file support for [blender](http://www.blender.org/)

## This addon has been archived. But.. don't worry, we created a new and much powerful one - [blender-xray](https://github.com/PavelBlend/blender-xray).
The new addon supports importing/exporting several file formats and also works well in Blender 2.80+. Hopefully, you'll enjoy using it in production.

## ~~Getting Started~~
 - download the [**io_scene_ogf**](io_scene_ogf) folder into your **blender/2.xx/scripts/addons** folder
 - set your gamedata-path in GAMEDATA_FOLDER variable (file: **io_scene_ogf/settings.py**)
 - enable the plugin in **File->User Preferences->Addons->Import-Export** by checking the box on the right of **Import-Export: OGF Tools**
